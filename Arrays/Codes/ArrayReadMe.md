📊 Array — DSA Implementations

This folder contains basic but important array operations that form the foundation of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
These programs helped me strengthen my concepts of indexing, iteration, and in-place modifications in arrays.

🧾 Files Included
1. 🌀 Swap.java

Description: Swaps two elements in an array using their indexes.

Concepts Used: Indexing, Temporary Variable, In-place Swap

Example:
Input → [1, 2, 3, 45, 6, 7] (swap index 2 and 3)
Output → [1, 2, 45, 3, 6, 7]

2. 📈 Max.java

Description: Finds the maximum value in a given subarray between a start and end index.

Concepts Used: Looping through subarrays, Conditional checks, Return max value

Example:
Input → Array: [91, 2, 3, 45, 6, 7], Start = 0, End = 2
Output → 91

⚠️ Note: There was a small bug in the condition (if(end>start) should be if(end<start)). Make sure to fix it to avoid errors.

3. 🔁 Reverse.java

Description: Reverses the entire array in place without using any extra array.

Concepts Used: Two-pointer technique, While loop, Swapping elements

Example:
Input → [91, 2, 3, 45, 6, 7]
Output → [7, 6, 45, 3, 2, 91]
